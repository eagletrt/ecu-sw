 * the physical interface used for logging (e.g. UART). 
 * If your system interfaces with separate physical protocols (such as a CAN bus), 
 * a distinct, separate `PalHandler` instance must be initialized for that peripheral 
 * to prevent transmission queue collisions and driver conflicts.
 * \warning If the \ref LoggerState passed is invalid, by default the logger will be disabled.
 * \param[in] pal_h Pointer to the initialized PAL configuration tracking block.
 * \param[in] state Indicate whether the logger should log any string passed or not after initialization.
 * \retval LOGGER_RC_OK if setup succeeds.
 * \retval LOGGER_RC_ERROR if the input pointer is \c NULL.
